Here's the promised update of all existing sitescripts to 2.15.6

All sets up to [822] (Magic Origins) are included, as far as a source url could be identified. Some unsorted promo sets may still be commented out.
As announced, I have neither resolved problematic cards (requires updating/adding namereplacement tables, and potentially other tricks for complicated corner cases),
 nor updated site.expected tables to let the script know exactly how many set/failed/dropped/namereplaced/foiltweaked cards are needed to consider the set imported perfectly.
In addition, all scripts now 
[list]
[*] respond properly to site.Initialize("update") or site.Initialize({ update=true })
[*] respond properly to site.BuildUrl("list"), implement
[*] have site.updateFormatString defined and adjusted
[*] implement site.FetchExpansionList()[/list]
Therefore, in the future, if you want to maintain one of the sitecripts, you can use the dummyMA.lua to run the sitescript in update helper mode
 which makes adding missing sets to the sitescript a breeze. Resolving missed/failed cards still requires manually looking for the right namereplacement,
  but the bulk of cards will probably work out-of-the-box.
