set	363	name:"Huracán" 						oracleName:"Hurloon Wrangler"	oracleName should be "Hurricane"
		name:"Fin de la desgracia visual"	oracleName:"Changeling Hero"	oracleName should be "Eyeblight’s Ending"
set 310	why does ma.SetPrice(310,5,"Ogre Berserker","",0.14,0,1) return 2 ?!
set 21 name "Plots that Span Centuries" should be "Plots That Span Centuries", as printed. I'm not sure about oracle name capitalization.
