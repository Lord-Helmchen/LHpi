LHpi is LordHelmchen's price import library and sitescripts for Magic Album.

LHpi is a collection of lua scripts to be used by Magic Album, but is '''''not''' part of Magic Album and thus updated and supported seperately''.

Discuss, ask for help and leave feedback at the [http://www.slightlymagic.net/forum/viewtopic.php?f=32&t=8174 corresponding Forum Thread].
==Sitescripts==
The sitescripts are the actual price import scripts, written in lua. They use the [[Magic Album Lua API]] and [[#The LHpi Library| the LHpi library]] to query and parse a website and import the price information into Magic Album. Most of the program logic is contained in the library, so the sitescript needs to hold only site-specific information and a few functions that are not easily generalizable.

In theory, you should not be dependent on a new version once a new set is available: just add new entries to site.sets table in the sitescript. Being easy to update yourself was one of the design goals.

Sitescripts will need to provide
* a table of supported sets with language and url infix fields
* a table of supported languages with url infix field
* a function to build urls
* a function to parse the html raw data into data fields via regular expressions (and the regex itself)
* optionally, they can also provide
** functions for site specific data manipulation, in case the site has some strange formatting the library does not understand
** a one-to-one name map for names that differ between the site and Magic Album's database
** tables to map card names to picture versions, in case the one-to-one map and LHpi's defaults are not sufficient
** a table with expected card count numbers for LHpi's sanity checks.

Functionally the same as [[#Other scripts|"MTG Mint Card.lua"]] by Goblin Hero and Stromglad1.

When I wanted to generalize my script for easy addaption to other sites, this provided me with a good baseline, since I could search MA for cards that my script missed but should have set. Also, the site is easy to querry and parse. They do have a currency chooser, so I started by trying to make a mtgmintcard-Euro script. I failed, but salvaged the wreck for default $ prices.

[http://magic.tcgplayer.com/magic_price_guides.asp Tcgplayer Price Guide] claims to accumulate prices from 75 online vendors. They are priced in $. Their tables give a high, low and average price; the sitescript contains a variable to select which one of those it should use.
<br />To change the column to import from, open the script in a text editor, find <code>himelo = 3</code> which should be around line 126 and change it to <code>himelo = 1</code> for high or <code>himelo = 2</code> for medium prices. You can have [[How-To_sitescriptTemplate#multiple_copies_ot_the_same_script|multiple copies ot the same script]]
<br />As requested by Golob [http://www.slightlymagic.net/forum/viewtopic.php?f=32&t=2324&start=300#p108605 here].
<br />Also, Promo and most special sets have not been tested yet and are commented out.
<br />Note that cards with multiple versions are averaged in some sets and set to "variant 1"'s price in others, as the source list does not clearly identify the version.
Even when it does, it is unclear if the entry without version suffix is meant to be all unspecified or version 1 only.
<s>As I wanted to keep this sitescript as basic as possible, I decided against guessing a real variant table and just added expected failcounts.</s>In most cases, "CARD" price is set for all versions and averaged with "CARD (version)" price for given versions now.

[http://www.trader-online.de/Magic_Online-Shop.php Trader Online] is a German site with German and English cards, priced in €.

I found this site while looking for Token images, found it to be parseable by sitescript, and decided to use it as a test on how well the library was adapted to support additional sites.

==The LHpi Library==

It is not expected to be fast, but as reliable as possible:<br />
It first compares the user requested sets and languages with what the sitescript has available and builds a table of urls to querry, seperated by set.<br />
Then it loops though the sets that are both available and selected:<br />
The raw html data is fetched, parsed and entered into an intermediate table of all prices for the current edition, merging regular and foil prices to minimize calls to ma.SetPrice.<br />
Should the same card (defined by set,card,language,(picture-)version ) be encountered again, it compares the prices. If they are equal, the new price is discarded; if they differ (Yes, magicuniverse.de's database is quirky), it uses the average price. Cards that are suffxed with a condition description are currently disregarded.<br />
Once that cardsetTable is completed (all urls belonging to the set are parsed), it sends the prices to MA.
Finally, it compares the count of set prices with the number of cards in the set (or, if given, the expectation given in the sitescript).
See [[How-To_sitescriptTemplate#procedure_of_function_calls]] for details.
Logging to a seperate file is now enabbled per default (but still configurable by the variable SAVELOG in the script), since ma.PutFile(file,data,0) behaviour bug was fixed. The log is overwritten on subsequent re-runs of the script.

===LHpi.Data===

Since library version 2.7, static set data (number of cards,foilage,variant and foiltweak tables) were moved into a seperate data file that gets loaded by the library on initialization. This will allow to distinguish between code updates (to the library) and set data updates (which are usually needed when a new set is released). Version numbering of the sitescripts will reflect both library and data versions used.

==Installation and usage==
#Download at least one sitescript and both the LHpi libray and data file in the version the sitescript uses.
#Unzip into the "Prices" subdirectory of your Magic Album installation.
#(recommended, but not yet strictly necessary) Create a subfolder called "lib" under "Prices" and move both library and data file into the subfolder.
#(optional) If you want to use the SAVEHTML feature, you need to create an empty subdirectory, named like the sitescript without version suffix (for example "Prices\LHpi.magicuniverseDE").
#(re)start Magic Album and use the sitescript ('''not''' the library nor the data file. Step 3 makes this warning obsolete.) from Magic Album's Price Manager dialog.

If something does not happen as expected
* make sure the script is saved utf-8 encoded. It's customary for lua scripts to be saved ANSI encoded, but as MA expects utf input, this is what I considered the most wysiwyg approach to set cards with special characters in their names.
* open the lua file in a text editor and change "VERBOSE = false" to "VERBOSE = true" (somewhere around line 33) and "--STRICTCHECKEXPECTED=true" to "STRICTCHECKEXPECTED=true". This will make the script provide feedback to help track down any problems (or just to see what it was doing) and also enable additional checks. The logging will be sent to "[MA Folder]\Prices\[scriptname].log".
I'll try to answer any questions you might have. If the script misbehaves please follow the two steps above and attach a copy of the .log to your post.

Magic Album API dummy to test and debug LHpi within an IDE (such as eclipse) and without needing Magic Album. Now fixed for backwards compatibility with Lua 5.1. 

===Planned features===
in no particular order
* Promo and special sets for <s>magicuniverseDE</s>,mtgmintcards, tcgplayerPriceguide
** add all <s>special and</s> promo sets (cardcount,variants,foiltweak) to LHpi.Data
* tweak log : better differentiation of log levels (normal,verbose,debug); rewrite normal-level logentries to be more pleasing to read.<br />I'd love to get users' feedback on this: how silent should normal level be; what should not be logged unless in debug mode?
*<code>(((a+b)/2)+c)/2 != (a+b+c)/3 = (((a+b)/2*2)+c)/3</code><br/> For mathematically correct averaging, need to attach a counter to averaged prices, then on next averaging, do <code>if counter then newaverage=(oldaverage*(counter+1) + newprice) / (counter+2)</code>

===Possible features===
in no particular order
* passing importsets to BuildCardData could sort out the mess that is magicuniverse's promo page, at the cost of lots looping through sets. Should thus be done in site.BCDPlugins
* ideally, most information in LHpi.sets could be read from MA via API getter functions.
* add hardcoded exchange rate for crude currency conversion between parsing and importing.
* <s>handle conflicting prices differently. Is averaging ok, or should the script discard one (which?) of the prices and/or throw an error ?</s> Until further notice, I'm ok with <s>how averaging works.</s>averaging conflicts. How it's done needs some work.
* import prices from condition-suffixed cards instead of dropping them.
**patch to accept entries with a condition description if no other entry with better condition is in the table:
***	buildCardData will need to add condition to carddata
***	global conditions{} to define priorities
***	then fillCardsetTable needs a new check before overwriting existing data
* add another sitescript (and adapt library if needed)

===Problems===
* can't set the sitescript's name dynammically.
 <nowiki>--[[FIXME the dynamic approach myname does not work, ma.GetFile returns nil for its own log :(
do
	--local _s,_e,myname = string.find( ma.GetFile("Magic Album.log"), "Starting Lua script .-([^\\]+%.lua)$" )
	if myname then
		scriptname = myname
	else -- use hardcoded scriptname as fallback
		scriptname = "LHpi.magicuniverseDE-v2.0.lua" -- should always be equal to the scripts filename !
	end
end
--]]
</nowiki>
* number of cards in set must be hardcoded into library. An [url=http://www.slightlymagic.net/forum/tracker.php?p=2&t=303 ma.GetCardsInSet( setid,langid,regular|tokens )] would help, but the numbers are easy to hardcode anyways.
* can't use mtgmintcard to get € prices. see [http://www.slightlymagic.net/forum/viewtopic.php?f=32&t=2324&start=285#p100271|here] for details.
* cards with quotation marks in their name currently confuse the script. Affected cards are
** “Ach! Hans, Run!” (UNH)
** Kongming, “Sleeping Dragon” (PTK)
** Pang Tong, “Young Phoenix” (PTK)
* Can't distinguish between regular and oversized versions of the same card. probably affects all Commander sets.
===Hints for developers===
Some information that might be useful if you want to write/improve sitescripts. Please add questions related to developing here, so I know what needs to be documented.

===version history===
I decided to start all versions at 2.0, since it's the continuation of magicuniverseDEv1.6.lua, but with enough changes to warrant the next major version number. <s>Do not expect revision numbers to stay synched.</s> <s>Starting with 2.2.1, sitescript minor version will conform to used library version, and the sitecripts will have their version suffixed.</s>Starting with 2.7 sitescript versioning will be libversion.dataversion.sitescriptrevision. This should make it more clear which versions to keep and what can be deleted after updating. The sitescripts will know which library and data version they need and attempt to load the right one or exit gracefully.
<br /><br />In case you need an old version or just want to see how the scripts have evolved: The version numbers below are also download links.
