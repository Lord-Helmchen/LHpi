As they say: release early, release often.
Most important changes in this version (see wiki for full changelog):
Improved http error handling by site.FetchSourceDataFromOauth in LHpi.magickartenmarkt and mkm-helper.
LHpi.mkm-helper now gracefully skips the current set on http errors (including 429 - Too Many Requests, which can happen often in the initial learning phase).
All functions in LHpi.dummyMA now consistently start with an upper case letter. Calls in other scripts were changed. 
LHpi.Data only received a minor fix/update (cardcount for 26).

If you're a seller on MKM and you're feeling adventurous, you might be interested to check out the new experimental, unpolished and largely undocumented checkstock mode in mkm-helper.
